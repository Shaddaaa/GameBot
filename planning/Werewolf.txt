Functionality:

!ww [j]oin allows users to join or create a ww game.
    Every server can only host one werewolf game, every user can only be part of one werewolf game.
    Trying to !ww join while in another room should notify the user.
!ww [l]eave allows users to leave their current room.
    This does not need to be done in the channel of their current game room.
    Room should get deleted if there are no users left playing
The first user who joined and hasn't left yet is known as the leader.
!ww [r]oles returns a list of all roles and the count
    !ww [r]oles [role] returns an explanation of what the specified role does.
!ww 


!ww [s]tart allows the leader to start the game, preventing anyone new to !ww join
Once a game has been started the bot will do the usual werewolf cycle of:
Night
    The bot asks for role specific input by each user in the order that is required by basic werewolf rules.
    For roles with multiple people that have to know each other (like werewolves) the bot creates a private group where they can discuss and vote via !ww [v]ote or something?
Day
    The bot announces any effects and deaths
    !ww [n]ominate [@user] to nominate a player to be killed
    !ww [v]ote [@user] to vote for a nominated player
